## What is this?

This is a faster, lighter, plugin-based alternative to [inquirer][], with support for all of the same prompt types and features. 

## Why another prompt modules?

We use prompts extensively in [generate][], [verb][], [update][] and [assemble][], and other libries we maintain, and we wanted to improve the user experience and reduce dependencies associated with other libraries we tried, like Inquirer. 

**Initial load time**

Enquirer takes **~11ms** to load. This is about the same amount of time that it takes [chalk][] to load.

By comparison, Inquirer takes **~120ms just to load**!!! This is about how long it takes babel, or other massive libraries that you would never include in production code.

Regardless of whether or not a prompt is every actually used, your own application will be 120ms slower from having Inquirer in its dependency tree. This is caused by its own massive dependency tree, code redundancy, monolithic and slow [reactive interface][] (which makes little sense for this use case anyway), poor API design (Inquirer actually executes code, even if you never call the library!), and so on. 

120ms might not seem like a lot, but there is a critical threshold where performance of an application begins to feel laggy, and this cuts into that threshold significantly, leaving less room for everything else.

## Usage

```js
var {%= alias %} = require('{%= name %}');
```

## API

{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

## Prompt types

**What is a prompt "type"?**

Prompt types determine the type of question, or prompt, to initiate. Currently, the only prompt type included in enquirer is `input`. 

The following types are all available as plugins:

- [ ] `checkbox` ([enquirer-prompt-checkbox][])
- [ ] `confirm` ([enquirer-prompt-confirm][])
- [ ] `editor` ([enquirer-prompt-editor][])
- [ ] `expand` ([enquirer-prompt-expand][])
- [x] `input` ([enquirer-prompt-input][]) (included in enquirer by default)
- [ ] `list` ([enquirer-prompt-list][])
- [ ] `password` ([enquirer-prompt-password][])
- [ ] `radio` ([enquirer-prompt-radio][])
- [ ] `rawlist` ([enquirer-prompt-rawlist][])

Or you can use [enquirer-prompts][], if you want a bundle with all of the listed prompt types.

### Publishing prompt modules

Prompt modules are named using the convention `enquirer-prompt-*`.

## Plugins

### Publishing plugin modules

Plugin modules are named using the convention `enquirer-*`.
