## What is this?

This is a faster, lighter, plugin-based alternative to [inquirer][], with support for all of the same prompt types and features. 

## Why another prompt modules?

We use prompts extensively in [generate][], [verb][], [update][] and [assemble][], and we wanted to improve the user experience and reduce dependencies associated with other libraries we tried, like Inquirer. 

**Initial load time**

This was a big motivator:

- Inquirer takes **~120ms** just to load! (due to massive dependency tree, code redundancy, etc).
- Enquirer takes **~11ms** to load

Fwiw, 120ms is amongst the slowest libraries we've found in node.js, similar to what you would expect from Babel or other monolithic libraries. 

## Usage

```js
var {%= alias %} = require('{%= name %}');
```

## API

{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

## Prompt types

### Publishing prompt modules

Prompt modules are named using the convention `enquirer-prompt-*`.

## Plugins
